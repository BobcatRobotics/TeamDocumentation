# Application Requirements

## Intro
Before writing any robot code, students need the right tools installed and configured.

## WPILib Requirements
Before installing WPILib, make sure your computer meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**:  
  - Windows 10/11 (64-bit)  
  - macOS 11 or newer  
  - Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended, other distros may work)  

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**:  
  - WPILib includes its own OpenJDK, but having JDK 17+ installed system-wide is recommended.  

- **Disk Space**:  
  - At least 1.5 GB free for the WPILib tools and dependencies.  

- **VS Code**:  
  - WPILib installer comes with a customized version of VS Code that includes all required extensions.  

- **Internet Connection**:  
  - Required for the initial installation (GradleRIO will also fetch dependencies the first time you build a project).  

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If you already have a global installation of VS Code or Java, WPILib will not interfere‚Äîit installs its own versions in a separate directory.

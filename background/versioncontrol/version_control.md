# Introduction to Version Control

Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to
software code, documents, or any type of digital content. It allows
teams (and individuals) to work collaboratively, keep a history of
edits, and revert back to earlier versions if necessary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Use Version Control?

1.  **Collaboration** -- Multiple developers can work on the same
    project without overwriting each other's work.\
2.  **History** -- Every change is tracked, making it easy to see who
    changed what and when.\
3.  **Backup** -- A complete history of the project is stored, so
    nothing is ever truly lost.\
4.  **Experimentation** -- Developers can try new ideas in isolated
    "branches" without affecting the main project.\
5.  **Accountability** -- Each change is linked to an author, helping
    teams maintain responsibility and traceability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Concepts

### Repository

A repository (or "repo") is the database where the project and its
version history are stored.

### Commit

A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Each
commit typically contains: - The changes made - The author of the
changes - A message describing the update

### Branch

Branches allow developers to work on different features or fixes
independently.\
- The **main branch** usually represents the stable version of the
project.\
- Other branches (like `feature/new-ui`) can be merged back into main
once completed.

### Merge

Merging combines the changes from one branch into another.

### Conflict

A conflict occurs when two branches modify the same part of a file
differently. Developers must manually resolve these differences.

## Popular Version Control Systems

-   **Git** -- The most widely used version control system today; it's
    distributed, meaning every developer has a complete copy of the
    repo.\
-   **Subversion (SVN)** -- A centralized system, once very popular
    before Git's rise.\
-   **Mercurial** -- Another distributed version control system, known
    for simplicity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Best Practices

-   Write **clear commit messages** (e.g., "Fix bug in login form
    validation").\
-   Commit **small, logical changes** instead of large, sweeping
    updates.\
-   Use **branches** for features and bug fixes.\
-   Keep your **main branch stable**.\
-   Regularly **pull and update** from the remote repository to avoid
    conflicts.

## Conclusion

Version control is an essential skill for developers and teams. It helps
manage collaboration, keeps track of changes, and ensures projects are
robust and maintainable over time. By mastering version control
(especially Git), you'll be equipped to work effectively in almost any
software development environment.
